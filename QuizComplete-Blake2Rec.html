<h1>Cryptographic Hash Quiz</h1><br>
<h2>Quiz Complete!</h2>
<br><br><br><br>
We recommend you use BLAKE2 <br><br>

	<p STYLE="margin: 30px 50mm 5% 10em">BLAKE2 is an offshoot of SHA-3 as some developers wanted 
		to loosen some of the parts of SHA-3 that slowed down its process due to the worry that 
		if SHA-3 did not solely focus on making sure it was secure it would have never been selected 
		making the developers slow SHA-3 down. To learn more about BLAKE2, please click
