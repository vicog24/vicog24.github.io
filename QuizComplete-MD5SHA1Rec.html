<h1>Cryptographic Hash Quiz</h1><br>
<h2>Quiz Complete!</h2>
<br><br><br><br>
We recommend you use either MD5 or SHA1 <br><br> 

	<p STYLE="margin: 30px 50mm 5% 10em">Once one of the most secure and fast hashing functions, 
		as well as the one relied on by so many, now has been broken time and time again leaving 
		it’s only true purpose to be to study more simple algorithms to learn about how they work and 
		more importantly what makes the vulnerable. To learn more about MD5, please click <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MD5"> here.</a> 
	</p> 

	<p STYLE="margin: 30px 50mm 10% 10em">Similar to MD5, once a great tool that was used by 
		many has now been beaten by modern day processing and now serves its purpose only as 
		a teaching tool and a relic as it is disallowed for use in modern day security. to learn
		more about SHA1, please click <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-1"> here.</a>
